# v2.1.8 - TUI Refactoring

**Release Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Commit:** a25b372

## Summary

Major terminal UI overhaul introducing fullscreen mode, virtualized list rendering, and timestamped report history. This release focuses on improved user experience with responsive layouts, theme consistency, and better data management.

## Key Changes

### Fullscreen TUI Mode
- Complete UI overhaul using `fullscreen-ink` package
- All components render in fullscreen with proper centering
- Responsive layouts using `FullScreenBox` and `useScreenSize`
- Adapts to terminal dimensions dynamically

### VirtualizedList Component
New reusable component for rendering large lists efficiently:
- Windowed rendering (only visible items rendered)
- Keyboard navigation (up/down arrows, page up/down)
- Configurable viewport size based on terminal height
- Smooth scrolling with position indicators

### ReviewPanel Improvements
- Collapsible summary panel (press 'S' to toggle)
- Severity breakdown display (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Category breakdown (Security, Performance, etc.)
- Text wrapping and truncation for detail views

### Timestamped Reports System
Reports now saved with timestamps for history tracking:
- Format: `report-{timestamp}.json`
- `latest.json` symlink to most recent report
- Auto-cleanup: 30-day retention, max 20 reports
- New `loadAllReports()` function for accessing history

### RunConsole Redesign
- Centered layout with bordered panels
- Rounded borders with theme-consistent colors
- Dot-leader stat formatting
- Section dividers using box-drawing characters
- Clean progress bar with percentage display

### Theme Consistency
- Removed all blue colors from UI
- Reverted to `ink-select-input` for custom theming
- All focus/highlight colors use theme primary (#ff5656)
